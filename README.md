# Scripts and Functionality Add-Ons for the <br> PWS_Dashboard / WeatherWatch Community

Scripts are organized using the following hierarchies: 

egtechgeek\PWS_Dashboard-WeatherWatch\ $category <br>
egtechgeek\PWS_Dashboard-WeatherWatch\ $application

## Readme info for each script can be found within its subdirectory.<br>

## Unlike the previous repo, i have actually enabled full notifications for this repo <br> so that i can better respond to feature requests, as well as provide support if necessary.
